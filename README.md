# Cube-Model
This was the first homework required to pass an exam that dealt with OpenGL and (optionally) other libraries that uses it as their basis.
Even though the nature of this program is quite simple (just a simple cube on a canvas that you can iteract with), trying to understand the logic behind the scenes and how the shaders in the .html file receive their data from the .js file was really counter-intuitive and hard to grasp at times. But it was necessary to understand the basics of interactive graphics, of course!
I had to write a report for this homework, so for more information you can read that!
